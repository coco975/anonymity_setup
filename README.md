## Overview

This Bash script, `anonymity_setup.sh`, automates the configuration of free, open-source tools in **Kali Linux** to maximize your online anonymity at **zero cost**. By leveraging **Tor** and **macchanger**, it hides your IP address, DNS queries, and MAC addressâ€”key identifiers that could otherwise compromise your privacy. The script also includes robust error handling and a fail-safe mechanism to revert changes if needed.

### Key Features
- **IP Address Anonymity**: Routes all traffic through the Tor network to mask your real IP.
- **DNS Query Anonymity**: Ensures DNS requests go through Tor, preventing leaks.
- **MAC Address Spoofing**: Randomizes your MAC address to avoid local network tracking.
- **Zero Cost**: Relies entirely on free tools with a zero-logs policy.
- **Fail-Safe Mechanism**: Restores original settings if the script fails or is interrupted.
- **Error Handling**: Logs every step and validates the setup for reliability.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux (latest version recommended).
- **Permissions**: Root access (run with `sudo`).
- **Internet Connection**: Needed to install tools and verify anonymity.
